1144 characters in total
22 newline characters
1122 actual characters

Even number

1122 / 2 = 561 characters
1122 / 3 = 374 characters
1122 / 4 = 280,5
1122 / 5 = 224,4

62 * in total:
- 3 pairs of 2
- 56 lone ones
-> What do these mean?

QX occurs 47 times
- 4 pairs of 2
- 43 lone ones

X in general is in the text a lot (207 times)
That's almost 1 in 5 characters

A is hardly there (4 times)

3x as XA
  2x followed by VP

Looking the letter frequencies We can try the following:

Theory:
X occurs most often, so it has something to do with the letter E
Let's say every letter is enciphtered as two cipherletters.
In that case we would suspect 12 different pairs for X:
Assuming X is the first letter of the pair.

X pairs in the text:
grep -E -o "X.{0,1}" stage3/ciphertext.txt | sort | uniq
X
X*
XA
XB
XC
XD
XE
XF
XG
XI
XJ
XK
XL
XM
XP
XQ
XR
XS
XT
XU
XV
XW
XX
XY
XZ

First one doesn't count, so 24 pairs in total. I was hoping for 12-13.

What is X is the second char? 

made@t470p:~/projects/cipher-challenge/stage3$ grep -E -o ".{0,1}X" ciphertext.txt| sort | uniq
BX
CX
FX
GX
IX
MX
NX
PX
QX
TX
VX
WX
*X
X
ZX

Replacing these with an e results in one-character gaps in the Ciphertext
Then the theory of two chars per letter is no longer valid


Let's start at the least frequent letter then.
A occurs 4 times
Least frequent letter of English is the Z


Looking at the letter O
- 8 occurrences
  - 7x XSOQX
  - 1x FSOF
  
UI
- 15 occurences
  - 
  
only doubles are
- EE 5x
- SS
- UU
- VV 1x
- WW 
- **  
  
  
Let's analyze QXQX
- 4 occurrences
- PU..SG
- UU..*X
- RP..YQ
- FS..QR

Letters that can occur as pair in English:
- ee
- ll
- oo
- ss
- zz

Theory:
Homophones don't have a fixed width, 
meaning they can vary in width (1-n characters)

I base this theory on the fact that splitting up the text 
in [1-n] length letter pairs doesn't give any satisfying results
(i.e. 100 different combinations for all occurrence percentages)

If we assume this theory we can look at *:
- It is the only non-letter 
- It occurs alone (56 times)
- It occurs in pairs (3 times)

There are some interesting occurrences of *:
- With only one letter in between
  - X (2x)
  - C
  - Z  
  - This would mean that these letters *can* also occur on their own.
- With two letters in between
  - IX
  - ZX
- With three letters in between
  - XEI
  - XLQ
  - CXC
  - FXC
  - XDI
etc.

Then after * we find
  - BX (5x, in last 3 lines)
  - 


*
- 56x alone
- 3x pairs

Similar patterns can be found with:
E
- 32x alone
- 5x pairs
S
- 34x alone
- 4x pairs
U
- 60x alone
- 5x pairs
V
- 54x alone
- 1x pairs
W
- 20x alone
- 3x pairs
Y
- 24x alone
- 3x pairs
X
- 205x alone
- 1x pair (IX/X*)

Pretty sure that QX also represents a letter
  - QX (39 occurrences)
  - QXQX (4 occurrences)
  
IX and ZX also.

interesting patterns:
- IX*IX*  
- ZX*ZX*

- TITX
- TI and TX are letters?



EQ only comes after X
  
BX is also a letter
ZX
FX
PU

X = e
U = t

Now we see many t.e appear -> the?
- . can be B C F I M Q Z
- 'h' should have 6 occurrences


Q = h


BV and BX occurring at the end


X*



Or with *, looking at the doubles
- I*, *Q, Q*, Z*
