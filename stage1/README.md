  in the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the
  candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw
  the part of the hand that wrote. then the king’s countenance was changed, and
  hys thoughts troubled hym, so that the joints of hys loins were loosed, and hys
  knees smote one against another. the king cried aloud to bring in the
  astrologers, the chaldeans, and the soothsayers. and the king spake, and said to
  the wise men of babylon, whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the
  interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold
  the king’s wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the
  abovt hys neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. then came in all
  king the interpretation thereof. then was king belshazzar greatly troubled,
  and hys coun tenance was changed in hym, and hys lords were astonished. now the
  queen, by reason of the words of the king and hys lords, came into the banquet
  house; and the queen spake and said, o king, live forever; let not thy thoughts
  trouble thee, nor let thy coun tenance be changed; there is a man in thy
  kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father
  light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in
  hym; whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, i say, thy father, made
  master of the magicians, astrologers, chaldeans, and soothsayers; forasmuch as
  an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams,
  and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same
  daniel, whom the king named belteshazzar; now let daniel be called, and he will
  show the interpretation. the first codeword is othello.
