> ## The Cipher Challenge
>
> The Cipher Challenge is a set of ten encrypted messages, which I placed at the
end of *The Code Book* when it was first published in 1999. In addition to the
intellectual reward of cracking all ten messages, there was a prize of Â£10,000
for the first person to solve the Challenge. The Challenge was eventually solved
on October 7, 2000, after one year and one month of arduous effort by
codebreakers, amateur and professional, around the world.
>
> The Cipher Challenge remains as part of this book. There is no longer a prize
associated with its solution, but I would encourage readers to decipher some of
the messages. The ten stages were intended to grow in difficulty, although many
codebreakers have felt that stage 3 is harder than stage 4. The ciphers used in
the stages differ and progress through the ages, so the early ciphers are
ancient and easy to break, whereas the latter stages employ modern ciphers and
require a great deal more effort. In short, stages 1 to 4 are for the amateur,
stages 5 to 8 are for the real enthusiast, and 9 and 10 are for those who are
dedicated codebreakers.

site (www.simonsingh.com), which offers a variety of information, including a
link to a report written by the Cipher Challenge winners, Fredrik Almgren,
Gunnar Andersson, Torbjorn Granlund, Lars Ivansson and Staffan Ulfberg. The
report makes excellent reading, but please be aware that it, and other material
on the Web site, does include spoilers that you might not want to see just yet.

> The main aim of the Cipher Challenge was to excite people, to get them
interested in cryptography and codebreaking. The fact that thousands of people
took up the challenge is tremendously satisfying. Officially the Cipher
Challenge is now over, but I hope that it will continue to generate some
interest among new readers who want to test their codebreaking skills.
